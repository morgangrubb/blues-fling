      Dance all day, dance all night — Blues fling offers four hours of workshops each day, and dancing 'til you drop each night.

      Each day of workshops will feature both Blues and Fusion classes that can take your dancing to the next level — Ted and Ruby are both AWESOME solo dancers, and we know you'll want to learn their moves.

      We run our dances like parties — with food, themes, and lots and lots of dancing.  Dress up, have fun, and bring your best — we'll have awesome DJs to bring you through the night.
