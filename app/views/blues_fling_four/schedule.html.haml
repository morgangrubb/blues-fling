      Dance all day, dance all night — Blues fling offers four hours of workshops each day, and dancing 'til you drop each night.
    %p
      Each day of workshops will feature both Blues and Fusion classes that can take your dancing to the next level — Ted and Ruby are both AWESOME solo dancers, and we know you'll want to learn their moves.

      We run our dances like parties — with food, themes, and lots and lots of dancing.  Dress up, have fun, and bring your best — we'll have awesome DJs to bring you through the night.
